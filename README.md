A Handwritten Character Recognition using CNN

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are one of the most popular models used today. This neural network computational model uses a variation of multilayer 
perceptron and contains one or more convolutional layers that can be either entirely connected or pooled. These convolutional layers create feature maps 
that record a region of image which is ultimately broken into rectangles and sent out for nonlinear processing. CNN is primarily used in object recognition 
by taking images as input and then classifying them in a certain category. Handwritten digit recognition is one of that kind. We will be having a set of images 
which are handwritten digits.
